# Business-Rules-Engine
Assignment

I have assumed that there is a database exist and the data for customer, orders etc. is exist.
This data can be used for this rule engine.

To run this application,

1. The main function have predefined input values set for various rules. We can change the values to test the rules.
2. Enums or predefined inputs are used here.
3. Change the order type to test other rules.

Thank you
